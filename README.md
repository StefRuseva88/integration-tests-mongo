- **Create**: Insert new movie entries into the database.
- **Read**: Retrieve and view movie details stored in the database.
- **Update**: Modify details of existing movies.
- **Delete**: Remove movie entries from the database.

## Technologies Used

- **.NET Core**: The primary framework used for building the console application.
- **MongoDB Compass**: The GUI for MongoDB used for managing the database.
- **MongoDB.Driver**: The .NET driver for MongoDB for database interactions.
- **xUnit**: A unit-testing framework for .NET applications.
- **nUnit**: A unit-testing framework for .NET applications.
